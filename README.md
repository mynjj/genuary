# Genuary

[Genuary](https://genuary2021.github.io/) is an event of creating [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art) based on prompts. 

It's meant to be a prompt for every day of January, but more realistically this will just be a repositoy with some sketches that I may update once in a while.

Feel free to have a [look](https://mynjj.github.io/genuary). Keep in mind, they are thought with a Desktop First UX, since they're mainly just toys for myself.
